They will open in a tab on the right.\n\n-   You can shrink the navigation bar by clicking on the folder icon next to the left of the + symbol.\n\nLet's look at this notebook. It is made of cells. If you click on one you will see a blue bar indicating the scope of the cell. If you double click on a cell, you can see how it was made. It is written in Markdown, a lightweight text markup language. Type `C-enter` (Control and enter at the same time) to render the cell.\n\nDouble click on the cell again. Now type `S-enter` (shift-enter) to render the cell and move to the next cell.\n\nWhen on a cell that is rendered, you can use the up and down arrows to move from cell to cell.\n\nWith your cursor on this cell, type `Esc-b` and then `Enter`. This will create a new cell after the cell, and enter it so you can add something. *The default mode for a cell is code.* This is a code cell. Type `print('Hi there')` and press `C-enter` to execute it. You should see some printed output.\n\nSelect your code cell by clicking on it. Now press `Esc` then `a`. That will insert a cell *above* the selected cell. Remember, by default this will be a code cell. We are going to change this to a Markdown cell. You can see it is a code cell at the top in the icons. The one that says \"Code\" tells you it is a code cell.\n\n![img](./screenshots/date-18-03-2020-time-13-10-52.png)\n\nNext, press `m`. You should see the cell type change to Markdown. Note you can use this menu with your mouse to change the cell type.\n\n![img](./screenshots/date-18-03-2020-time-13-11-41.png)\n\nNow press `Enter` to go into the cell, or double click in it.

The are also *executable* documents. Some important points to remember:\n\n1.  The code is for a computer, and it represents your attempt to convert some idea in your head into an executable program.\n2.  You cannot expect others to read your mind and guess what your intentions were. You have to use the narrative text in the Markdown cells to explain what you are trying to do, what approximations you have to make to accomplish it.\n\nLet's see a real example of this.

It is usually a set of numerical values that are collected. It is critical to know something about your data so you understand what analysis may be appropriate. Data is a plural word. Datum is the singular form of data.\n\nFor example, here are two sets of data on my weight:\n\n1.  [7.5, 46, 150, 157]\n2.  [156, 155, 158, 157]\n\nWe are missing some context on these. The first set is data over four decades, while the second set is over four days. It doesn't really make sense to average the first set, whereas the average of the second set gives you a good idea of how my weight fluctuates on a daily basis.\n\nData by itself is not helpful. It is analysis of data that is helpful, but you have to know what the data is supposed to represent to know if the analysis is helpful.\n\nThere are many kinds of analysis one can do: statistical, regression, integration, etc. Each of these has the purpose of extracting information from the data.\n\nLet's consider the average and standard deviation of the second weights above. To perform this analysis, we need a computational tool, we will use Python. We will extensively use numpy arrays for data analysis. We start by making an array in a variable called weights. Then, we simply call the mean and std functions of that array inside a formatted string.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"# Out [4]:\n# output\nMy average weight is 156.5 \\pm 1.1 lbs."}],"source":["import numpy as np\n\nweights = np.array([156, 155, 158, 157])\nprint(f'My average weight is {np.mean(weights)} \\pm {np.std(weights):1.1f} lbs.')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["This analysis makes sense *if* we think my weight fluctuates about some average with a normal distribution of fluctuations. We do not have enough data to determine if it is normal here, but it is worth noting that assumption underlies the analysis. Note, we also assume that each measurement is independent, and uncorrelated with the previous and next measurement. If I weigh myself only once a day, that is probably reasonable. If these are sequential weights separated by 1 minute, then either something is wrong with the scale or, I am doing something funny in how I weigh myself.\n\nWhat factors could affect the weight measurement?\n\n1.  What am I wearing?\n2.  What and when did I last eat/drink?\n3.  When was the last time I exercised and for how long?\n4.  Are all the measurements from the same scale?\n\nThe answers for all these constitute the *metadata*, which is data about the data. If we had access to this metadata, we might ask if any of these factors influence the measurements. As we consider more dimensions like this,  it becomes inconvenient to visualize and build models with conventional tools, and we then will turn to machine learning.\n\nThere is a lot to learn about using data before we get to machine learning though.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Breakout rooms\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Let's take a break here from the lecture and try the breakout rooms.
