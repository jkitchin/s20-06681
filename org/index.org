#+title: Data science and machine learning in chemical engineeringg
#+author: John Kitchin

These are lecture notes from a mini course I taught on data science and machine learning in chemical engineering.

These are the official lectures from the class. I hope they work for you, but there may be links to files in a google drive that only CMU students can access. Let me know in an [[https://github.com/jkitchin/s20-06681/issues][issue]] if you find one.

Good luck!

* Setup the publishing project                                     :noexport:

- org :: the org-files for the notebooks  [[./org]]
- docs :: the place to publish the html files
- docs/notebooks :: place to publish the notebooks

https://github.com/jkitchin/f19-06623/tree/master/docs
https://github.com/jkitchin/f19-06623/blob/master/docs/notebooks/00-intro.ipynb

Note I did a fair bit of editing of results that had output that looked like links.
